Beelzebot is powered by the GM Discord extension made by Ches Rowe here: https://github.com/chesrowe/GMDiscord
He's also powered by llama3.2 via ollama running on a local machine, more on that here: https://github.com/ollama

He's very early works, and not ready for primetime yet, but I know people like open source code <3
